There is 3 main packages `config`, `factory` and `model`. Inside each there is corresponding content. 
## Singleton
For `Singleton pattern` check for `CinemaConfig` class inside `config` package that uses `Singleton pattern` to create global settings that will be used in project. 
## Factory
For `Factory pattern` check `factory.movie` and `model.movie` packages. Classes inside `model.movie` package just represents real-life like models of movies and it's types. Classes inside `factory.movie` is implementation of `Factory pattern`.
## Abstract Factory
For `Abstract factory pattern` check `factory.button` and `model.button`. Explanation the same as for `Factory` except of `model.button` these models represent buttons in UI for delevopers.
## Builder 
For `Builder pattern` check `TicketBooking` class inside `model` package. So `Builder` is implemented inside `TicketBooking` class as static class.
## Prototype
For `Prototype pattern` check `model.schedule` package. I myself don't actually know is it right so there is no explanation.
